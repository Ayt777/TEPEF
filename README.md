Turbulence effects induced $C_n^2$ probing and evolutionary framework (TEPEF)
======
Overview
-------
Atmospheric turbulence, prevalent in natural and engineering systems, presents significant challenges for probing 3D refractive index structure constant $C_n^2$ due to its inherent randomness, complex structures, and spatiotemporal coupling. Despite the complexities, the optical degradations induced by multi-directional turbulence in multi-view images create an opportunity to learn the hidden 3D $C_n^2$ through turbulence imaging. In this study, a turbulence effects induced $C_n^2$ probing and evolutionary framework, termed TEPEF, is proposed. The TEPEF is composed of two sub-networks: the turbulence imaging effects induced 3D $C_n^2$ probing network (TIEPN) and turbulence spatiotemporal effects induced 3D $C_n^2$ evolution network (TSEEN), achieving accurate atmospheric turbulence probing and evolution prediction. The accurate acquisition of 3D $C_n^2$ provides, for the first time, a precise approach for obtaining comprehensive statistical turbulence properties. Additionally, we have demonstrated the practical utility of TEPEF in astronomical site selection, achieving accurate estimations of atmospheric coherence length $r_0$ and $seeing$.
